        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <div class="roles-wrapper inspiration">
          With inspiration from 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Craig
          created this weekly planner that is based on your local machine.
          Read this brief description about 7-Habits' weekly planner from
          chatGPT:
          <br />
          <br />
          The 7 Habits Weekly Planner is a tool designed to help individuals
          organize and prioritize their tasks and activities in alignment with
          Stephen Covey's "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"
          philosophy. This planner typically incorporates Covey's principles
          into its structure, focusing on key habits such as being proactive,
          beginning with the end in mind, prioritizing tasks, seeking first to
          understand, and synergizing. The planner usually provides sections
          for users to list their goals, tasks, and priorities for the week,
          along with spaces for reflection and evaluating progress. It often
          emphasizes the importance of scheduling activities based on values
          and long-term goals rather than simply reacting to urgent demands.
          Overall, the 7 Habits Weekly Planner serves as a practical tool to
          help individuals manage their time effectively, align their actions
          with their values, and work towards their personal and professional
          objectives in a structured and intentional manner.
